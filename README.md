## Background

Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games, and its simple mechanics have inspired countless adaptations. This project brings the timeless gameplay of Pong into a futuristic, cyberpunk setting. By incorporating neon lights, fast-paced visuals, and impactful sound design, the aim was to create a more immersive experience for players. Additionally, the game offers both human vs human and AI opponents, enhancing replayability.

## Development Process

1. **Planning**: Defined core mechanics, such as player movement, ball physics, and game reset functionality.
2. **Prototyping**: Built the Pong arena using Unity, focusing on the atmosphere of a cyberpunk world.
3. **Implementation**: Added features like human vs AI gameplay, random ball direction, and collision-based sparks.
4. **Testing & Tuning**: Iterated on the controls, ball speed, and AI difficulty to ensure a balanced and engaging experience.

## Design Goals

- **Atmosphere**: Create an immersive cyberpunk environment with colorful neon lights and responsive visual effects.
- **Simplicity**: Retain the simple, easy-to-learn mechanics of the original Pong while adding modern touches.
- **Challenge**: Provide both human and AI opponents to cater to different types of players.

## Core Features

- **3D Pong Arena**: The game world is designed with a cyberpunk aesthetic, featuring bright, colorful lights and futuristic visuals.
- **Two Players**: Supports human vs human or human vs AI gameplay.
- **Responsive Controls**: Players can only move up and down, making the game easy to pick up but difficult to master.
- **Dynamic Ball Physics**: The ball's direction changes based on where it hits the paddles, and it starts each round in a random direction.
- **Reset Mechanism**: The game resets after a goal, with a 3-second countdown to restart.
- **Start and Stop**: The game begins when the spacebar is pressed.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: For developing the game environment and handling game mechanics.
- **C#**: For scripting game behavior and player controls.
- **Blender**: For designing 3D models.
- **Visual Studio**: For coding and debugging.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/re-xandria/cyberpunk-pong.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity:
    - Launch Unity Hub and open the cloned project folder.
3. Run the game:
    - Press the Play button in Unityâ€™s editor to start the game.

## Future Work

- **Start Menu & Pause Menu**: Implement menus for starting, pausing, and restarting the game.
- **AI Customization**: Allow players to choose between human vs human or human vs AI opponents.
- **Player Customization**: Add customization options for the player paddles (e.g., colors, styles).
- **Expanded Sound Design**: Introduce more dynamic sound effects for hits and goals.
